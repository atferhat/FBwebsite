I received extensive training from world-renowned institutions to lead projects successfully published in international scientific journals. My professional experience has given me the ability to interact with collaborators and to bring everyone's capacities towards the same objective as well as to be the representative of the project at international meetings. As well, I characterized and quantified heterogeneous datasets where I used my expertise in different statistical tools, (e.g. statistical models, machine learning, Bayesian statistics approach), as well as analyze of large dataset (e.g. RNA sequencing, brain waves, behavior).
