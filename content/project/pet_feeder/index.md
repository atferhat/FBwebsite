When you have several cat, it is often a nightmare to control the quantity of food. This project, based on this one (https://www.instructables.com/Automatic-Arduino-Powered-Pet-Feeder/), aim to create a pet feeder that deliver food to the cat according to a RFID chip carry by the cat.
This project use Raspberry pi and Arduino, servo motor, weight balance and RFID reader. The last bonus will be using the raspi to add a camera.
